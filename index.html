                           <h3>Reasoning</h3>
                            Over the past decade more and more companies are migrating and creating a virtual presence. By removing human interaction from different processes companies and customers reap the benefits. Customers can access tracking information with a click of a button,
                            companies can repurpose manpower to other crucial areas of their businesses. Innovative companies like Amazon, and Google have revolutionized the concept of an "Online Company". <br> <br>

                            By redesigning the way Corsicana Mattress does business the company they will  be able to help customer for efficiently, increase market share, build a stronger brand, increase credibility and reputation, and become more cost efficient.

                                Many companies now offer online tracking for customer orders, which has caused it to become an expected service. One of the biggest issues for customers
                                when ordering from manufactuers is not knowing an ETA for your shipment. Without the ETA customers spend unnecesary money on dayworkers to help unload orders. BY building an
