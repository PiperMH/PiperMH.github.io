                            Sales reps and managers are expected increase market share while maintaining current customer relations. However, Corsicana Mattresses (CM) processes have become outdated and non efficient, which
                            is causing the use of unnecessary department resources. By redesigning the way Corsicana Mattress does business, GoCorsicana will
                            be able to help customer more efficiently, increase market share, build a stronger brand, increase credibility and reputation, and become more cost efficient.

                            <h3>Approach</h3>
                            To create the portal my lead architect and business analyst first outlined the infrastructure between the company’s enterprise software, tracking software and the future web application.
                            Once the we applications architecture was decided, I spent time researching other SAAS applications and how they outlined their services interfaces.
                            After analyzing other applications, I was able to create low fidelity mock-ups of the portals interface using photoshop and XD. My team members and
                            I then discussed the pros and cons of the mock-ups and decided on the most efficient interface design. Once this decision was made,
                            I worked with my senior front end developer to build the portal’s APIs and interface.

                                My goal was to understand what type of interface design was most commonly used.
                                By comparing other websites I was able to get insight into what other company's viewed as the best user experience.

                                The first mock-ups for both the log in screen and the portal template did not end up being the final product. With multiple versions and iterations the product owner
                                decided on a design that incorporated both thw initial and new ideas. As the portal itself developed so did the message, and for this reason the decision was made to
                                take advantage of the login page's real estate by including the portal's purpose and current services.

                                Making sure that the portal and its applications were compatible with different web browsers, operating systems, and devices was the biggest design requirement.
                                This was also one of the biggest frustrations. When you design and develop interfaces you quickly realize how complicated it is to build for every device out there. <br> <br>
                                As the portal continues to grow, the more responsive and compatible it becomes. QA is not only important for application behavoir purposes, but also to make sure an element or
                                style is supported by a browser or operating system.

                                The reason behind the changes were that current log in screen included content that did not pertain to future users and it was too busy.
                                The portal template also needed to be redesigned to reduce the navigation size to allow more room for content.

                            Order Tracker is an application in the GoCorsicana Portal that allows the sales team and customers to easily track orders.

                                Corsicana's sales team and customers did not have a fast and efficient way to track orders.
                                Sales reps and customers would have rely customer service for updates on current orders.
                                Corsicana Mattress wanted to create an online application that would allow people to easily track
                                their orders and reduce the amount of time customer service spent on relaying order updates.

                                To create the application my team’s business analyst and lead architect outline the approach needed to pull order detail information from Corsicana Mattresses’ EP system and tracking information
                                from the TMS system. Once the approach had been decided, our business analyst gathered requirements by discussing with the director of sales about the information needed to be accessible in the application.
                                With the processes and requirements documented, I designed a few low fidelity mock-ups using photoshop and XD of the potential application.
                                My team members and I then discussed and decided on the most efficient and mobile responsive interface.
                                With the designs in hand, I built out the front-end APIs and interface for the tracking application.<br><br>

                                After the front end and server side of the application was connected, my business analysts and I QA tested to make sure
                                the application behaved correctly. With a few minor adjustments my team and I had built the first service in the
                                GoCorsicana portal - the order tracking application.

                              The order tracker is a data driven application, which means it is text heavy. Designing an interface for a text heavy application comes with its own challenges.
                                One of the biggest challenges faced was how to create an aesthetically pleasing interface that was also affective and efficient when used on both desktop and mobile devices.

                                tracker application must be redesigned to be faster and more user friendly. While the queries are being rewritten to be more efficient, the front end is being redesigned for two different user types.
                                One design will be implemented for sales reps and managers, and another design will be implemented for customers.

                                The custom table my senior develop and I implemented allows all tables on GoCorsicana to be mobile friendly. As the screen's width shrinks columns are removed and the information is displayed
                                within in an accordion.

                                <h3>Reasoning</h3>
                                The process for onboarding new customers has become outdated and inefficient.
                                To mainstream the process and reduce the number of man hours needed to onboard new customers Corsicana Mattress decided to move customer onboarding online.

                                To create a mobile responsive application that allows sales reps, accounts receivable, and logistics to on-board new customers.

                                <h3>Approach</h3>
                                To create the customer onboarding application, my senior business analyst and I discussed the current onboarding process with the different departments involved.
                                Once the workflow and requirements were documented we were able to refine both areas to process to make it more efficient.
                                After the final workflow and requirements were decided I was created a few low-fidelity mock-ups of the user interface. My manager and I then agreed on the most efficient user interface to build upon.
                                Once the final high-fidelity mock-up was created, we handed it along with the workflow diagrams to our outsourced development team who handled the development and QA of the application.

                                Designing an interface means understanding the workflow of an application. The customer onboarding application involved three different departments who each
                                played an intricate part of the process. The final workflow came to existent after multiple iterations of the initial process.

                                High fidelity mock-ups become a template more than a blue print to build from. What is constructed in PhotoShop and XD may look
                                and function better than what is built in HTML5 and CSS3. The final product may be very similar to the final mock-up but there are most likely a few
                                adjustments in the final product.
