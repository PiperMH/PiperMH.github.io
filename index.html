                           <h3>Reasoning</h3>
                            Sales reps and managers are to expected increase market share while maintaining current customer relations.
                            However, Corsicana Mattresses (CM) processes have become outdated and inefficient causing the use of unnecessary department resources.
                            By redesigning Corsicana Mattress’s business approach, GoCorsicana will be able to help customers more effectively,
                            increase market share, build a stronger brand, increase credibility and reputation, and become more cost efficient.

                            <h3>Objective</h3>
                            To designed and helped develop a role based online portal that aggregates reports and business applications in to one easily accessible location.

                            <h3>Approach</h3>
                            To create the portal my lead architect and business analyst first outlined the infrastructure between the company’s enterprise software,
                            tracking software and the future web application. Once the architecture was finalized, I researched other SAAS applications and their service interfaces.
                            After analyzing other applications, I was able to create low fidelity mock-ups of the portal’s interface using photoshop and XD. My team members and I then
                            discussed the pros and cons of the mock-ups and decided on the most efficient interface design. Once this decision was made,
                            I worked with my senior front-end developer to build the portal’s APIs and interface.

                                Before creating detailed mock-ups, I reviewed other SAAS applications.
                                My goal was to understand what type of interface design was most commonly used.
                                By comparing other websites I was able to get an insight into what other company's viewed as the best user experience.

                                I discovered that data and text heavy SAAS applications have the following commonalities.

                                As the portal itself developed so did the message.
                                A decision was made to take advantage of the login page's real estate by including the portal's purpose and current services.

                                Corsicana's sales team and customers did not have a fast and efficient way to track orders. They relied on customer
                                service for updates on current orders. To improve efficiency and lower customer service cost, Corsicana Mattress created an online application that allowed users to track their own orders.

                                To create the application my team’s business analyst and lead architect outlined the approach needed to pull order details from the EP system and tracking information from
                                the TMS system.After my business analyst gathered application requirements from the director of sales the processes and requirements were established.
                                After I designed a few low fidelity mock-ups using photoshop and XD of the potential application.
                                My team and I decided on the most efficient and mobile responsive interface. With the designs in hand, I developed the front-end APIs and interface for the tracking application.

                                an interface for a text heavy application comes with its own challenges.
                                One of the biggest challenges faced was how to create an aesthetically pleasing interface that was also effective and efficient when used on both desktop and mobile devices.

                            CCustomer Onbaording is an application in the GoCorsicana Portal that allows sales reps, accounts receivable and logistics to on-board new customers with ease.

                                <h3>Reasoning</h3>
                                The process for onboarding new customers has become outdated and inefficient.
                                To mainstream the process and reduce the number of man hours needed to onboard new customers Corsicana Mattress decided to move customer onboarding online.

                                To create a mobile responsive application that allows sales reps, accounts receivable, and logistics to on-board new customers.

                                <h3>Approach</h3>
                                To create the customer onboarding application, my senior business analyst and I discussed the current onboarding process with the different departments involved.
                                Once the workflow and requirements were documented we were able to refine both areas to process to make it more efficient.
                                After the final workflow and requirements were decided I was created a few low-fidelity mock-ups of the user interface. My manager and I then agreed on the most efficient user interface to build upon.
                                Once the final high-fidelity mock-up was created, we handed it along with the workflow diagrams to our outsourced development team who handled the development and QA of the application.

                                Designing an interface means understanding the workflow of an application. The customer onboarding application involved three different departments who each
                                played an intricate part of the process. The final workflow came to existent after multiple iterations of the initial process.

                                High fidelity mock-ups become a template more than a blue print to build from. What is constructed in PhotoShop and XD may look
                                and function better than what is built in HTML5 and CSS3. The final product may be very similar to the final mock-up but there are most likely a few
                                adjustments in the final product.
